 *   ONBOARDING -> /onboarding (allowed there)
 *   PENDING    -> /pending    (allowed there, and on /onboarding for edits)
 *   DENIED     -> /pending    (allowed there)
 *   APPROVED   -> /           (requireApprovedUser lets it through)
 * so every redirect lands somewhere that accepts the user, in exactly one hop.
